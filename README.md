# "Mobile Flashcards" app

## Project Overview:

The UdaciCards project is a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## How to install

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/Rehab-Ahmed253/reactnd-udaciCards
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```

_This app was tested on an Android device_
